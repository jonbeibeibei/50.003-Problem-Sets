wait() and notify() act on the default condition variable that exists per object. Thus if they are not synchronized on the same object, we can end up with interleaving between the condition checking statement and the wait()/notify() statement, which can result in Process1 changing the condition to true and calling notify() after Process2 has checked checked that the condition is falsed, and then calling wait() after which it may end up waiting indefinitely.
